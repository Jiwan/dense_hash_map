- Benchmarks.
- Setup travis.
- Doc.
- Start with size 0 for buckets (verify if worth it).

Done:
- Disable copy-constructor for pair types that do not support them.
- Test allocator support.
- noexcept as much as possible!
- Unit-tests for all functions and stuff.
- Move only types...
- Exception free.
- double check everything.
- Slap constexpr as much as possible.
- Pass test with ASAN and UBSAN.
